Additional, this was the first personal usage of Jest/Testing as well as exploring the basics of SVG style images.

 ## Installation

Download the contents of this repository, then save or unzip them into a single folder. Using Visual Studio Code, you can open that folder. Right-click on index.js and select "Open in Integrated Terminal". For the initial startup, type into the command line terminal "npm install" which will take a few seconds to install the list of dependencies. Once that is complete, type into the command line terminal "node index.js". This will initialize the questionnaire process, which will detail each section of your logo.


## Usage

If Inquirer is installed, the user can type "node index.js" into the command line terminal to start the application. Once the application is started, a series of questions will be asked of the user to customize different parts of the logo.

## Contributing

Improvements to include more shapes or more complex logo designs would be possible for future development. There is also more extensive use of validate to incorporate user input limits to control the answers, which would avoid any glitches or deviations from standard colours or letters.

## Tests

To test the application, open the command console for the folder and first run "npm install" to install dependencies, and then run "npm test". The shapes.test.js file will be run to test each shape for Triangle, Square, and Circle.
